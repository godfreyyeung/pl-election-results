# Election Results

## Assumptions

This interactive visualization aims to address the following user story:

> As a campaign manager, I want to see a choropleth map of difference in percent of
votes between my political party and a competing party across states in the USA.
This will help me determine what regions to invest campaign money and travel time.

The user story will be satisfied with...

1. Dropdown to select personal political party
2. Dropdown to select competing political party
3. Choropleth map of 50 states, symbolized according to difference in percent of votes.
4. Ability to hover over each state and see difference in percent of votes.
